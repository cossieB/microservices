A sequel, The Last of Us Part II for PlayStation 4, was released by Naughty Dog in 2020 to similar acclaim, though the narrative polarized critics and audiences. </p>\n	United States

The department responsible for developing original games, CD Projekt Red (stylised as CD PROJEKT RED), best known for The Witcher series, was formed in 2002. In 2008, CD Projekt launched the digital distribution service Good Old Games, now known as GOG.com.</p>\n<p>The company began by translating major video-game releases into Polish, collaborating with Interplay Entertainment for two Baldur&#39;s Gate games. CD Projekt was working on the PC version of Baldur&#39;s Gate: Dark Alliance when Interplay experienced financial difficulties. The game was cancelled and the company decided to reuse the code for their own video game. It became The Witcher, a video game based on the works of novelist Andrzej Sapkowski.</p>\n<p>After the release of The Witcher, CD Projekt worked on a console port called The Witcher: White Wolf; but development issues and increasing costs almost led the company to the brink of bankruptcy. CD Projekt later released The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings in 2011 and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt in 2015, with the latter winning various Game of the Year awards. In 2020, the company released Cyberpunk 2077, a role-playing game based on the Cyberpunk 2020 tabletop game system for which it opened a new division in Wrocław.</p>\n<p>A video game distribution service, GOG.com, was established by CD Projekt to help players find old games. Its mission is to offer games free of digital rights management (DRM) to players and its service was expanded to cover new AAA and independent games.</p>\n<p>In 2009, CD Projekt&#39;s then-parent company, CDP Investment, announced its plans to merge with Optimus S.A. in a deal intended to reorganise CD Projekt as a publicly traded company. The merger was closed in December 2010 with Optimus as the legal surviving entity; Optimus became the current incarnation of CD Projekt S.A. in July 2011. By September 2017, it was the largest publicly traded video game company in Poland, worth about US$2.3 billion, and by May 2020, had reached a valuation of US$8.1 billion, making it the largest video game company in Europe. In March 2018, the company joined WIG20, an index of the 20 largest companies on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.</p>\n	Poland

Destiny is now self-published by Bungie after separating from Activision in 2019. It was released worldwide on September 9, 2014, for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One consoles. Destiny marked Bungie&#39;s first new console franchise since the Halo series, and it was the first game in a ten-year agreement between Bungie and Activision. </p>\n<p>Set in a &quot;mythic science fiction&quot; world, the game features a multiplayer &quot;shared-world&quot; environment with elements of role-playing games. Activities in Destiny are divided among player versus environment (PvE) and player versus player (PvP) game types. In addition to normal story missions, PvE features three-player &quot;strikes&quot; and six-player raids. A free roam patrol mode is also available for each destination which feature public events. PvP features objective-based modes, as well as traditional deathmatch game modes. Players take on the role of a Guardian, protectors of Earth&#39;s last safe city as they wield a power called Light to protect the City from different alien races. Guardians are tasked with reviving a celestial being called the Traveler, while journeying to different planets to investigate and destroy the alien threats before humanity is completely wiped out. </p>\n<p>Bungie released four expansion packs, furthering the story, and adding new content, missions, and new PvP modes. Year One of Destiny featured two small expansions, The Dark Below in December 2014 and House of Wolves in May 2015. A third, larger expansion, The Taken King, was released in September 2015 and marked the beginning of Year Two, changing much of the core gameplay. The base game and the first three expansions were packaged into Destiny: The Taken King Legendary Edition. Another large expansion called Rise of Iron was released in September 2016, beginning Year Three. Rise of Iron was only released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One; PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 clients subsequently stopped receiving content updates. The base game and all four expansions were packaged into Destiny: The Collection. A sequel, Destiny 2, released in September 2017. </p>\n<p>Upon its release, Destiny received generally positive reviews, with praise for its gameplay, graphics, and for maintaining lineage from the Halo franchise, particularly in regards to its competitive experiences. Criticism centered mostly around the game&#39;s storyline and post-campaign content. It has been cited as one of the greatest video games ever made. It sold over US$325 million at retail in its first five days, making it the biggest new franchise launch of all time. It was GamesRadar&#39;s 2014 Game of the Year and it received the BAFTA Award for Best Game at the 2014 British Academy Video Games Awards. </p>\n	7c792946-b6b5-4615-933b-919acbfd5afd	f49414e0-df6f-4420-ab86-ec73732058ef	2014-09-09 10:00:00	{"first person shooter",multiplayer,rpg}	{}	/images/image19.jpg	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jv7vqCmt6wY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

It was released worldwide for the Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and OS X platforms in 2013, and a Linux port was released in 2015. Infinite is the third installment in the BioShock series, and though it is not immediately part of the storyline of previous BioShock games, it features similar gameplay concepts and themes. </p>\n<p>Irrational Games and creative director Ken Levine based the game&#39;s setting on historical events at the turn of the 20th century, such as the 1893 World&#39;s Columbian Exposition, and based the story on the concept of American exceptionalism, while also incorporating influences from more recent events at the time such as the 2011 Occupy movement. The game is set in the year 1912 and follows its protagonist, former Pinkerton agent Booker DeWitt, who is sent to the airborne city of Columbia to find a young woman held captive, named Elizabeth. Though Booker rescues Elizabeth, the two become involved in the war between the nativist and elite Founders that rule Columbia and the rebel Vox Populi representing the underclass of the city. During this conflict, Booker learns that Elizabeth possesses strange powers to manipulate &quot;Tears&quot; in the space-time continuum that ravage Columbia, and soon discovers her to be central to the city&#39;s dark secrets. </p>\n<p>The player controls Booker Dewitt throughout the game, eventually working with the AI-controlled Elizabeth. Like previous BioShock games, the player uses a combination of weapons, clothing called Gear that offer unique attributes, and psychokinetic powers granted through Vigors. Elizabeth&#39;s powers can also be used to help fight hostile forces. In contrast to the limited spaces of the underwater city of Rapture, the openness of Columbia provides for more dynamic combat, including combat that takes place aboard the city&#39;s Sky-Line roller coaster-like rail system. Downloadable content for the game includes a story-based mission, Burial at Sea, that links Infinite&#39;s story to that of the original BioShock game. </p>\n<p>The game won over 85 pre-release awards for its display at E3 2011, including Best of Show from the Game Critics Awards. At release, BioShock Infinite received critical acclaim, with praise particularly directed at its story, setting, and visual art design, and is often regarded as one of the best video games of the seventh generation of consoles and one of the greatest video games ever made. According to review aggregator Metacritic, it was the third-highest rated video game of 2013. Within two months of release, it sold over 3.7 million retail copies, and has since sold more than 11 million copies overall. It won year-end accolades, including Game of the Year from several gaming publications. It was re-released on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch as part of the remaster compilation BioShock: The Collection. </p>\n	d685b781-8987-427b-8cac-21a59aeaebd4	fb201322-1134-4af3-bdf8-9b9b033a0fc5	2013-03-26 10:00:00	{scifi,"first person shooter"}	{}	/images/image12.jpg	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5gBVZj6ROV0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The game was released on Microsoft Windows on September 21, 2010,[1] on OS X on November 23, 2010, and on Linux on June 10, 2014. In Civilization V, the player leads a civilization from prehistoric times into the future on a procedurally generated map, attempting to achieve one of a number of different victory conditions through research, exploration, diplomacy, expansion, economic development, government and military conquest. The game is based on an entirely new game engine with hexagonal tiles instead of the square tiles of earlier games in the series.</p>\n<p> Many elements from Civilization IV and its expansion packs have been removed or changed, such as religion and espionage (although these were reintroduced in its subsequent expansions). The combat system has been overhauled, by removing stacking of military units and enabling cities to defend themselves by firing directly on nearby enemies.</p>\n<p>In addition, the maps contain computer-controlled city-states and non-player characters that are available for trade, diplomacy and conquest. A civilization&#39;s borders also expand one tile at a time, favoring more productive tiles,[7] and roads now have a maintenance cost, making them much less common.[8] The game features community, modding, and multiplayer elements.</p>\n<p>It is available for download on Steam. Its first expansion pack, Civilization V: Gods &amp; Kings, was released on June 19, 2012, in North America and June 22 internationally. It includes features such as religion, espionage, enhanced naval combat and combat AI, as well as nine new civilizations A second expansion pack, Civilization V: Brave New World, was announced on March 15, 2013.

A spiritual successor to 2004&#39;s Red Dead Revolver, it is the second game in the Red Dead series. Red Dead Redemption is set during the decline of the American frontier in the year 1911 and follows John Marston, a former outlaw whose wife and son are taken hostage by the government in ransom for his services as a hired gun. Having no other choice, Marston sets out to bring three members of his former gang to justice. </p>\n<p>The game is played from a third-person perspective. The player may freely roam in its interactive open world, a fictionalized version of the Western United States and Northern Mexico, primarily by horseback and on foot. Gunfights emphasize a gunslinger gameplay mechanic called &quot;Dead Eye&quot; that allows players to mark multiple shooting targets on enemies in slow motion. The game makes use of a morality system, by which the player&#39;s actions in the game affect their character&#39;s levels of honor and fame and how other characters respond to the player. </p>\n<p>An online multiplayer mode is included with the game, allowing up to 16 players to engage in both cooperative and competitive gameplay in a recreation of the single-player setting. The game&#39;s development lasted over five years, and it became one of the most expensive video games ever made. Rockstar improved its proprietary game engine to increase its technological capabilities. </p>\n<p>The development team conducted extensive research, visiting historical American landmarks and analyzing classic Western films, to achieve realism while creating the game. The team hired professional actors to perform the body movements through motion capture. Red Dead Redemption features an original score composed by Bill Elm and Woody Jackson. The game&#39;s development received controversy following accusations of unethical working practices. The working hours and managerial style of the studio was met with public complaints from staff members. Red Dead Redemption was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in May 2010. It received critical acclaim for its visuals, music, performances, gameplay, and narrative. </p>\n<p>It won several year-end accolades, including Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications, and is considered by critics as one of the best video games ever made. It had shipped around 23 million copies by 2021, making it one of the best-selling video games. After the game&#39;s release, several downloadable content additions were released; Undead Nightmare, later released as a standalone game, added a new single-player campaign in which Marston searches for a cure for an infectious zombie plague. A prequel, Red Dead Redemption 2, was released in October 2018. </p>\n	bf98f3eb-ef44-4b2e-bc54-2bc72e37124f	4aca5a63-4613-42fc-a916-ebbb8f91f61f	2010-05-18 10:00:00	{"3rd person shooter",western}	{}	/images/image17.jpg	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-o7rES_3ymA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
ae1aefd4-2d56-45e4-9d98-7489abe52cff	Titanfall	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/84/Titanfall_box_art.jpg	<p>Titanfall is a multiplayer first-person shooter video game developed by Respawn Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts. It was released for Windows and Xbox One on March 11, 2014; an Xbox 360 version ported by Bluepoint Games was released April 8, 2014. The game was anticipated as the debut title from developers formerly behind the Call of Duty franchise. </p>\n<p>In Titanfall, players control &quot;Pilots&quot; and their mech-style Titans, and fight in six-on-six matches set in the war-torn outer space colonies of the Frontier. The game is optimized for fast-paced, continual action, aided by wall-running abilities and populations of computer-controlled soldiers. Up to 50 characters can be active in a single game, and non-player activity is offloaded to Microsoft&#39;s cloud computing services to optimize local graphical performance. </p>\n<p>The game&#39;s development team began work on the title in 2011, and their Titan concept grew from a human-sized suit into a battle tank exoskeleton. The team sought to bring &quot;scale, verticality, and story&quot; to its multiplayer genre through elements traditionally reserved for single-player campaigns. The 65-person project took inspiration from Blade Runner, Star Wars, Abrams Battle Tank, and Masamune Shirow of Ghost in the Shell. </p>\n<p>Titanfall won over 60 awards at its E3 2013 reveal, including a record-breaking six E3 Critics Awards and &quot;Best of Show&quot; from several media outlets. It also won awards at Gamescom and the Tokyo Game Show. Titanfall received generally favorable reviews. Reviewers praised its balance, Smart Pistol weapon, player mobility, and overall accessibility for players of all skill sets, but criticized its thin campaign, disappointing artificial intelligence, and lack of community features and multiplayer modes. Critics considered the game a successful evolution for the first-person shooter genre but did not agree as to whether the game delivered on its anticipation. On March 12, 2015, it was announced that a sequel, Titanfall 2 was in production for Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. It was released on October 28, 2016. </p>\n	620ff02c-ea1b-4965-9ca2-198853c4d469	fc670432-5567-47b6-93ec-5d414a1c560d	2014-03-11 10:00:00	{"first person shooter",scifi}	{}	/images/image20.jpg	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3FPtT4C870c" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Players control Joel, a smuggler tasked with escorting a teenage girl, Ellie, across a post-apocalyptic United States. The Last of Us is played from a third-person perspective. Players use firearms and improvised weapons, and can use stealth to defend against hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures infected by a mutated fungus in the genus Cordyceps. In the online multiplayer mode, up to eight players engage in cooperative and competitive gameplay. </p>\n<p>Development of The Last of Us began in 2009, soon after the release of Naughty Dog&#39;s previous game, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. For the first time in the company&#39;s history, Naughty Dog split into two teams; while one team developed Uncharted 3: Drake&#39;s Deception, the other half developed The Last of Us. </p>\n<p>The relationship between Joel and Ellie became the focus, with all other elements developed around it. Actors Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson portrayed Joel and Ellie, respectively, through voice and motion capture, and assisted creative director Neil Druckmann with the development of the characters and story. The original score was composed and performed by Gustavo Santaolalla. Following its announcement in December 2011, The Last of Us was widely anticipated. </p>\n<p>It was released for the PlayStation 3 in June 2013; a remastered version was released for the PlayStation 4 in July 2014.[a] It received critical acclaim, with praise going to narrative, gameplay, visuals, sound design, characterization, and depiction of female characters. </p>\n<p>The Last of Us became one of the best-selling video games, selling over 1.3 million units in its first week and 17 million by April 2018. The game won year-end accolades, including multiple Game of the Year awards, from several gaming publications, critics, and game award ceremonies. It has been cited as one of the greatest video games ever made. Naughty Dog released several downloadable content additions; The Last of Us: Left Behind adds a single-player campaign following Ellie and her best friend Riley. The Last of Us Part II, a sequel, was released in June 2020. A television adaptation is currently in production by HBO, written by Druckmann and Craig Mazin and starring Pedro Pascal as Joel and Bella Ramsey as Ellie. </p>\n	ae414dcc-53a1-4959-bee1-431aed2b91c0	2f33a082-d3c5-459f-a469-f55f1156afb8	2013-06-14 10:00:00	{"action adventure",stealth,"3rd person shooter"}	{}	/images/image22.jpg	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OQpdSVF_k_w" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

It is the fourth main entry in the Uncharted series. </p>\n<p>Set several years after the events of Uncharted 3: Drake&#39;s Deception, players control Nathan Drake, a former treasure hunter coaxed out of retirement by his presumed-dead brother Samuel. With Nathan&#39;s longtime partner, Victor Sullivan, they search for clues for the location of Henry Avery&#39;s long-lost treasure. A Thief&#39;s End is played from a third-person perspective, and incorporates platformer elements. Players solve puzzles and use firearms, melee combat, and stealth to combat enemies. </p>\n<p>In the online multiplayer mode, up to ten players engage in co-operative and competitive modes. Development of Uncharted 4 began in 2011, soon after the release of Uncharted 3. </p>\n<p>It was led by creative director Amy Hennig and game director Justin Richmond. Development was hampered in 2014 due to Hennig and Richmond&#39;s departure from Naughty Dog; they were replaced by Neil Druckmann and Bruce Straley. The team sought to incorporate elements of open-world gameplay, with larger levels to encourage free-roaming exploration and combat. The relationship between Nathan and Elena was central, and Naughty Dog attempted to humanize them more than in previous games. </p>\n<p>A Thief&#39;s End was released in May 2016 for the PlayStation 4. It was the first Naughty Dog game developed specifically for the PlayStation 4. The team took advantage of the hardware to process larger dynamic environments. </p>\n<p>Following its announcement in November 2013, A Thief&#39;s End was widely anticipated. The game was acclaimed by critics, praising its gameplay, narrative, emotional depth, visuals, and multiplayer. Several reviewers found the game a worthy conclusion to Nathan&#39;s story. It won several year-end accolades, including Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications, critics, and award ceremonies. With over 15 million copies sold, it is the highest-selling Uncharted game and one of the best-selling PlayStation 4 games. A standalone expansion, Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, was released in 2017. A remastered version, alongside The Lost Legacy as part of the Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection, was released in January 2022 for PlayStation 5, and will be released later in 2022 for Microsoft Windows. </p>\n	ae414dcc-53a1-4959-bee1-431aed2b91c0	2f33a082-d3c5-459f-a469-f55f1156afb8	2016-05-10 10:00:00	{"action adventure","3rd person shooter"}	{}	/images/image23.jpg	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hh5HV4iic1Y" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
186a8b2d-b089-4b13-9290-7194f6be1750	Assassins Creed IV: Black Flag	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/28/Assassin%27s_Creed_IV_-_Black_Flag_cover.jpg	<p>Assassin&#39;s Creed IV: Black Flag is a 2013 action-adventure video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. It is the sixth major installment in the Assassin&#39;s Creed series. Its historical timeframe precedes that of Assassin&#39;s Creed III (2012), but its modern-day sequences succeed III&#39;s own. Black Flag was originally released for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii U in October 2013 and a month later for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows. It was later re-released on the Nintendo Switch as part of The Rebel Collection alongside Assassin&#39;s Creed Rogue in December 2019. </p>\n<p>The plot is set in a fictional history of real-world events and follows the millennia-old struggle between the Assassins, who fight to preserve peace and free will, and the Templars, who desire peace through control. The framing story is set in the 21st century and depicts the player as an employee of Abstergo Industries (a company used as a front by the modern-day Templars), who is manipulated into uncovering secrets related to the Assassin-Templar conflict and the precursor race known as the First Civilization. The main story is set in the West Indies during the Golden Age of Piracy from 1715 to 1722, and follows notorious Welsh pirate Edward Kenway, grandfather and father of Assassin&#39;s Creed III protagonist Ratonhnhaké:ton / Connor and antagonist Haytham Kenway, respectively, as he searches for fortune and a mythical location called the Observatory, which is sought by both the Assassins and the Templars. </p>\n<p>A major plot element concerns the attempted establishment of an independent Pirate republic in the Caribbean. Unlike previous games, gameplay elements focus more on the ship-based exploration of the seamless open world map, while also retaining the series&#39; third-person land-based exploration, melee combat, and stealth system. Multiplayer also returns, albeit with only land-based modes and settings. The game&#39;s setting spans the West Indies with the three main cities of Havana, Nassau, and Kingston, along with numerous islands, sunken ships, and forts. </p>\n<p>Players have the option to harpoon large sea animals and hunt land animals. For the first time in the series, naval exploration is a major part of an Assassin&#39;s Creed game, where Edward captains the Jackdaw, a brig he captures from a Spanish fleet in an early game mission. A number of downloadable content (DLC) packs were released to support Black Flag, including Assassin&#39;s Creed Freedom Cry, a story expansion that was later made available as a standalone game in 2014. Set over a decade after Black Flag&#39;s main campaign, Freedom Cry follows Adéwalé, Edward&#39;s former quartermaster who became an Assassin. </p>\n<p>Assassin&#39;s Creed IV: Black Flag received critical acclaim and was one of the best-selling games of 2013, with over 15 million copies sold as of 2020. Critics praised the open world gameplay, improved naval combat, side-quests, graphics, narrative, characters, and pirate theme. However, the modern-day story and combat received a slightly more mixed response, while criticism fell on aspects of the historical story missions which were considered repetitive. The game received several awards and nominations, including winning the Spike VGX 2013 award for Best Action Adventure Game. It was followed by Assassin&#39;s Creed Rogue and Assassin&#39;s Creed Unity in November 2014. </p>\n	c9d4d3f5-3763-4af6-a59a-8c532194ba29	5f03b65f-5fd9-4188-bcc8-d0a54d93b56f	2013-10-29 10:00:00	{"action adventure","3rd person","sword fighting","ship battles"}	{}	/images/image24.jpg	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MtZBuWgnkzk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

It is the third main installment in the Far Cry series after Far Cry 2. </p>\n<p>The game takes place on the fictional Rook Islands, a tropical archipelago which can be freely explored by players. Gameplay focuses on combat and exploration. Players can use a variety of weapons to defeat human enemies and hostile wildlife, and the game features elements found in role-playing games such as skill trees and experience. After a vacation goes awry, protagonist Jason Brody must save his friends, who have been kidnapped by pirates, and escape from the island and its unhinged inhabitants. </p>\n<p>Ubisoft Montreal collaborated with Ubisoft&#39;s global development team, including Massive Entertainment, Ubisoft Shanghai, Ubisoft Bucharest, Ubisoft Reflections and Red Storm Entertainment. The game&#39;s development was partially restarted in 2010 after the departure of several key creative staff. The team evaluated the feedback for Far Cry 2 and identified areas that needed to be improved or removed. The team spent considerable time designing the island, which they described as the &quot;second most important character&quot; in the game. Inspirations were taken from films and TV shows such as Apocalypse Now and Lost, as well as video games The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and Red Dead Redemption. </p>\n<p>Michael Mando was hired to portray Vaas Montenegro, an antagonist the team compared to Darth Vader. The game was announced in June 2011 and Ubisoft promoted the game with various companion apps, webseries and crossover. It was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in November 2012. The game received critical acclaim upon release, with praise directed at its characters (particularly Vaas), world design, visuals, progression, and gameplay, though the game&#39;s multiplayer modes received criticism. Despite weak pre-order sales, nearly 10 million copies of the game were sold. It was nominated for multiple year-end accolades including Game of the Year and Best Shooter awards by several gaming publications. Ubisoft supported the game with downloadable content and released Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon, the game&#39;s standalone expansion, in 2013. A successor, Far Cry 4 was released in November 2014. The game was re-released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in June 2018. </p>\n	c9d4d3f5-3763-4af6-a59a-8c532194ba29	5f03b65f-5fd9-4188-bcc8-d0a54d93b56f	2012-11-29 10:00:00	{"first person shooter"}	{}	/images/image25.jpg	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J6gnOVJsCsM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

It is the third game in the Just Cause series and the sequel to 2010&#39;s Just Cause 2. It was released worldwide in December 2015, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Set six years after its predecessor, Just Cause 3 follows series protagonist Rico Rodriguez as he returns to his homeland of Medici, a fictional Mediterranean island country under the control of dictator General Sebastiano Di Ravello. </p>\n<p>The game is played from a third-person perspective and allows players to explore the tropical island of Medici in an open world environment. Just Cause 3 received mixed reviews. Critics praised its open-ended gameplay, destruction mechanics, and emphasis on player agency. Criticism was directed both at its narrative, which some considered clichéd and uninspired, and also its performance issues, particularly on the console versions of the game. A sequel, Just Cause 4, was released in 2018. </p>\n	f58181ae-3b61-4c64-b3ff-fcbbce25c5bd	dddc460e-9389-4ea9-ba24-7139d51d92fe	2015-12-01 12:00:00	{"action adventure","third person shooter","open world"}	{}	/images/image28.jpg	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lqk71-DKd9s" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

It is the sequel to 2011&#39;s Saints Row: The Third and the fourth installment in the Saints Row series. The game was released in August 2013 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360, and was later ported to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Linux in 2015. A Nintendo Switch port was released on March 27, 2020 and a Google Stadia port was released on November 1, 2021. </p>\n<p>The game&#39;s open world nature allows players to freely explore a simulation of the fictional city of Steelport while completing main and side missions at their leisure. It also incorporates science fiction elements, and continues the series&#39; reputation for over-the-top parody. The single-player story follows the same player-created character from the previous games, who becomes elected President of the United States after thwarting a terrorist threat. Five years into their governance, they find themselves trapped in the Steelport simulation along with members of their gang, the 3rd Street Saints, after an alien empire known as the Zin attack the Earth and capture them. With help from some Saints who managed to escape and hacked the simulation to give them superpowers, the player attempts to rescue their captured friends, escape the simulation, and defeat the Zin. </p>\n<p>Saints Row IV was the first game developed by Volition following its acquisition by Koch Media in early 2013. The supernatural and superpower concept for the game started in Enter the Dominatrix, a cancelled expansion planned for Saints Row: The Third, which the team expanded into Saints Row IV. Volition later released a &quot;director&#39;s cut&quot; of Enter the Dominatrix as downloadable content for Saints Row IV alongside How the Saints Saved Christmas, various weapons, costumes, and vehicle packs, and a standalone expansion, Saints Row: Gat Out of Hell (which serves as an epilogue to the base game&#39;s story). The game received several limited and summative edition releases, and was briefly banned in Australia. It was met with generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its humor and character customization options, but criticized its lack of challenge. It also performed very well financially, selling over one million copies in its first week. The next game in the series, a reboot titled simply Saints Row, is scheduled to be released in August 2022.</p>\n	4ddfe727-cc2a-4c8c-b83c-9fc744623238	3db238b8-528d-4459-97a3-83210321a132	2013-08-20 10:00:00	{scifi,"3rd person shooter","open world"}	{}	/images/image6.jpg	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0qhFgMRlgNo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
ff0c5b54-ea32-4454-a0c9-eca494d687b9	Sunset Overdrive	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/46/Sunset_Overdrive_cover.jpg	<p>Sunset Overdrive is an action-adventure shooter video game developed by Insomniac Games and published by Microsoft Studios. </p>\n<p>The game is set in 2027, in a fictional metropolis called Sunset City. The player controls an employee of FizzCo, who has to fight off the OD, short for Overcharge Drinkers: humans who have turned into mutants after drinking FizzCo&#39;s energy drink beverage. In the dystopian Sunset City, the player character can wall-run, use zip-lines, and grind rails to swiftly navigate through it, with a large arsenal of weapons to use. The game also has a cooperative multiplayer mode called Chaos Squad, which tasks players to complete a series of missions with seven players. As the game puts emphasis on momentum, the game does not feature any cover system. The development of the game began in 2011 when Insomniac completed Resistance 3. After the project was green-lit internally, the studio partnered with Microsoft Studios, which helped fund the game and allowed Insomniac to keep the rights to the franchise. </p>\n<p>Insomniac described the game as a &quot;celebration of games&quot;, as the team took inspiration from different sources, including Prince of Persia, Jet Set Radio and Tony Hawk&#39;s Pro Skater, though at its early stage of development the team took inspirations from DayZ instead. The game is set in a post-apocalyptic future, but the team depicted it as an &quot;awesomepocalypse&quot; that turns the game&#39;s initial world depiction into a &quot;playground&quot; for players. Sunset Overdrive uses Insomniac&#39;s internal engine, previously used in Fuse. It was announced at E3 2013, and released worldwide for Xbox One in October 2014. A Windows version, developed by Blind Squirrel Games, was released in November 2018. The game received generally positive reviews, with praise for its visuals, traversal system, combat system, and humor. However, the game was criticized for the lack of a compelling story or innovative quest design. It received numerous nominations, including Best Xbox Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications. The game was supported with multiple pieces of downloadable content, including the story-based The Mystery of the Mooil Rig and Dawn of the Rise of the Fallen Machine, after the game&#39;s release. </p>\n	c816121e-ac20-498d-a4da-c8cdf12fec98	fe188fb8-10d7-440d-b3a7-0561918534f5	2014-10-28 10:00:00	{"action adventure","3rd person","open world"}	{}	/images/image27.jpg	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cOSnhhWcukk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The story was written by science fiction author Karen Traviss. Like its predecessors, Gears of War 3 received widespread critical acclaim from critics. Critics praised its story, voice acting, visuals, and music, but criticized its lack of innovation.

The story follows a new group of Vault Hunters who must ally with the Crimson Raiders, a resistance group made up of civilian survivors and guerrilla fighters, to defeat the tyrannical Handsome Jack before he can unlock the power of a new Vault. </p>\n<p>The game features the ability to explore the in-game world and complete both main missions and optional side quests, either in offline splitscreen, single-player or online cooperative gameplay. Like its predecessor, the game features a procedurally generated loot system which is capable of generating numerous combinations of weapons and other gear. With the unexpected success of the first game, Gearbox was able to secure a budget of $30–35 million to develop the sequel. Like its predecessor, the game adopted the &quot;concept art style&quot;, which features graphics inspired by both photorealistic imagery and comic-book-inspired visuals. The team attempted to address players&#39; feedback from the first game, and recruited Anthony Burch who wrote the game&#39;s script which is seven times longer than that of the original game. Among the game&#39;s diverse cast of characters, Handsome Jack, the central antagonist, was created to be a charismatic &quot;douche&quot; that mirrors Burch&#39;s own personality. </p>\n<p>Borderlands 2 was released for Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in September 2012, and it was ported to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One as part of The Handsome Collection in March 2014. The game received universal acclaim upon release. Critics generally praised the game&#39;s visuals, story, writing, gameplay, and online multiplayer, as well as its variety of guns, while criticising its mission design and content fillers. The handheld and the virtual reality versions of the game were regarded to be inferior to the console and PC versions.

25f5216d-b6be-40d3-a410-d17c915acbf2	The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/15/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_cover.png	<p>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an action role-playing video game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks. It is the fifth main installment in the Elder Scrolls series, following 2006&#39;s The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 on November 11, 2011. </p>\n<p>The game is set 200 years after the events of Oblivion, and takes place in Skyrim, the northernmost province of Tamriel. Its main story focuses on the player&#39;s character, the Dragonborn, on their quest to defeat Alduin the World-Eater, a dragon who is prophesied to destroy the world. Over the course of the game, the player completes quests and develops the character by improving skills. The game continues the open-world tradition of its predecessors by allowing the player to travel anywhere in the game world at any time, and to ignore or postpone the main storyline indefinitely. </p>\n<p>Skyrim was developed using the Creation Engine, which was rebuilt specifically for the game. The team opted for a unique and more diverse open world than Oblivion&#39;s Imperial Province of Cyrodiil, which game director and executive producer Todd Howard considered less interesting by comparison. Upon release, the game received critical acclaim, with praise for its character advancement, world design, visuals, and dual-wielding combat, and is considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever made. Criticism targeted the melee combat, the artificial intelligence of dragons, and the numerous technical issues present at launch. </p>\n<p>The game shipped over seven million copies within the first week of its release, and sold 30 million copies on all platforms by 2016, making it one of the best selling video games in history. Three downloadable content (DLC) add-ons were released separately—Dawnguard, Hearthfire and Dragonborn–which were bundled along with the base game into The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim – Legendary Edition and released in June 2013. A remastered version, titled The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim – Special Edition, was released for Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in October 2016, with all three DLC expansions and a graphical upgrade. A port for the Nintendo Switch was released in November 2017. A separate VR-only version, titled The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim VR, was released in November 2017 for PlayStation 4 using PlayStation VR, and for Windows-based VR headsets in April 2018. In addition, the Special Edition was released on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S as part of the compilation The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim – Anniversary Edition in November 2021. </p>\n	5b8a4cc6-8f63-4bbb-91ee-d0afb61a3121	4311b9dd-af4e-4747-a353-91bb5bee7d63	2011-11-11 10:00:00	{"open world",rpg,fantasy,"action adventure"}	{}	/images/image31.jpg	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JSRtYpNRoN0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

It is the fourth main game in the Fallout series and was released worldwide on November 10, 2015, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. </p>\n<p>The game is set within an open world post-apocalyptic environment that encompasses the city of Boston and the surrounding Massachusetts region known as &quot;The Commonwealth&quot;. It makes use of a number of local landmarks, including Bunker Hill, Fort Independence, and Old North Bridge near Concord, as the bridge out of Sanctuary Hills. The main story takes place in the year 2287, ten years after the events of Fallout 3 and 210 years after &quot;The Great War&quot;, which caused catastrophic nuclear devastation across the United States. The player assumes control of a character referred to as the &quot;Sole Survivor&quot;, who emerges from a long-term cryogenic stasis in Vault 111, an underground nuclear fallout shelter. After witnessing the murder of their spouse and kidnapping of their son, the Sole Survivor ventures out into the Commonwealth to search for their missing child. </p>\n<p>The player explores the game&#39;s dilapidated world, completes various quests, helps out factions, and acquires experience points to level up and increase the abilities of their character. New features to the series include the ability to develop and manage settlements and an extensive crafting system where materials scavenged from the environment can be used to craft drugs and explosives, upgrade weapons and armor, and construct, furnish and improve settlements. Fallout 4 also marks the first game in the series to feature full voice acting for the protagonist. Fallout 4 received positive reviews from critics, with many praising the world depth, player freedom, overall amount of content, crafting, and soundtrack. Criticism was mainly directed at the game&#39;s visuals and technical issues. </p>\n<p>The game was a commercial and critical success, generating $750 million within the first 24 hours of its launch, and received numerous accolades from various gaming publications and award events, including the respective awards for Game of the Year and Best Game at the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences and British Academy Games Awards. Bethesda has released six downloadable content add-ons, including the expansions Far Harbor and Nuka-World. </p>\n	5b8a4cc6-8f63-4bbb-91ee-d0afb61a3121	4311b9dd-af4e-4747-a353-91bb5bee7d63	2015-11-10 10:00:00	{"action rpg","first person shooter",scifi,"open world"}	{}	/images/image13.jpg	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X5aJfebzkrM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
cc3fa800-8066-4a3e-930f-f8e3d3db4970	Remember Me	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/32/Remember_Me_%28Capcom_game_-_cover_art%29.jpg	<p>Remember Me is an action-adventure video game developed by Dontnod Entertainment and published by Capcom. It was released worldwide in June 2013 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The game&#39;s plot focuses on Nilin, a memory hunter working for an underground resistance called the Errorists. When the game starts, she has been stripped of nearly all her memories by megacorporation Memorize. With the help of a mysterious man named Edge, she goes on a quest to bring down Memorize and recover her lost memories. Throughout the story, she is permitted to use her Memory Remix power to ultimately refurbish people&#39;s recollections. The combat consists of a modified combo system called Pressen.</p>\n<p>Remember Me was developed as the debut project of Dontnod Entertainment, with one of the company&#39;s founding members Jean-Maxime Moris as its director. Part of his goal for the game was to create a thought-provoking narrative, and eventually settled on a female protagonist to help convey the story&#39;s themes. Originally a PlayStation 3-exclusive under Sony titled Adrift, it was cancelled in 2011 and later purchased by Capcom which resurrected it as a multi-platform game. Remember Me received mixed reviews upon release; praise was given to its world design, Olivier Deriviere&#39;s soundtrack, the ambition of the story and the Memory Remix segments, while the main criticisms laid against other aspects of the story, poor design choices and formulaic combat.</p>\n	856ec139-a7fb-4238-b68d-b20317949080	74668f0a-20e0-4d26-a724-631803c6a800	2013-06-03 12:00:00	{scifi,"3rd person","action adventure",fighting}	{}	/images/image26.jpg	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DcDokdOTaXo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
2d8f2041-14aa-4385-976c-417391cbb74b	Dishonored 2	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5f/Dishonored_2_cover_art.jpg	<p>Dishonored 2 is a 2016 action-adventure video game developed by Arkane Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. It is the sequel to 2012&#39;s Dishonored. After Empress Emily Kaldwin is deposed by the witch Delilah Copperspoon, the player may choose between playing as either Emily or her Royal Protector and father Corvo Attano as they attempt to reclaim the throne. Emily and Corvo employ their own array of supernatural abilities, though the player can alternatively decide to forfeit these abilities altogether. Due to the game&#39;s nonlinear gameplay, there are a multitude of ways to complete missions, from non-lethal stealth to purposeful violent conflict.</p>\n<p>Ideas for Dishonored 2 began while developing the downloadable content of its predecessor, which spawned the decision to create a voice for Corvo Attano after being a silent character in the first installment. The advancement of the timeline was brought about once Emily Kaldwin, a child in Dishonored, was proposed as a playable character. The game&#39;s aesthetic was influenced by paintings and sculptures. Set in the fictional city of Karnaca, its history was invented in the span of one year. The city itself was based on Southern European/Mediterranean countries like Greece, Italy, and Spain, drawing on the architecture, fashion, and technologies of 1851. Voice actors include Rosario Dawson, Sam Rockwell, Robin Lord Taylor, Jamie Hector, Pedro Pascal, and Vincent D&#39;Onofrio.</p>\n<p>Dishonored 2 was released to a positive reception. Praised were the improvements made since the first game: the more challenging stealth, the adaptability of Emily and Corvo&#39;s abilities to both play styles, the art direction, the creative design of individual missions, the realization of the game&#39;s world as well as the replay-value and the artificial intelligence. Criticism was directed at the lack of focus of the overarching narrative. Aside from this, technical blunders, as well as issues with the PC version at launch, were received unfavorably, and the lack of content at launch was criticized. To remedy these problems, the game was updated numerous times during its life-cycle, with a New Game Plus mode, quick save and quick load feature, and a customizable difficulty setting being added in the game. Dishonored 2 won the award for Best Action/Adventure Game at The Game Awards 2016 and for Costume Design at the 2017 NAVGTR Awards.</p>\n	2d6fbb0c-8043-48ba-92a1-e4bfc087c39d	4311b9dd-af4e-4747-a353-91bb5bee7d63	2016-11-11 12:00:00	{"action adventure","first person",stealth,fantasy}	{}	/images/image34.jpg	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7bLNC8VDTlQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The game features a save system called &quot;Soul Links&quot;, which allows players to save their progress at will with limited resources, and an upgrade system that gives players the ability to strengthen Ori&#39;s skills and abilities.</p>\n<p>The game was developed by Moon Studios, a collective organization without a set location. The distribution rights to the game were acquired by Microsoft a year after the beginning of the game&#39;s development. The game story was inspired by The Lion King and The Iron Giant, while some of the gameplay elements were inspired by the Rayman and Metroid franchises.</p>\n<p>Upon release, the game received critical acclaim, with players praising the gameplay, art direction, story, action sequences, musical score, and environmental design. The game was also dubbed as one of the titles that represented art in video games. Moon Studios co-founder Gennadiy Korol said the game was profitable for the company within a few weeks after its initial launch. An expansion, called the Definitive Edition, was released in March 2016. A direct sequel, Ori and the Will of the Wisps, was announced during Electronic Entertainment Expo 2017 and was released on March 11, 2020.</p>\n	e4efb2df-e3bb-4ee0-942e-51ae34a7ef95	fe188fb8-10d7-440d-b3a7-0561918534f5	2015-03-11 12:00:00	{platformer}	{}	/images/image35.jpg	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cklw-Yu3moE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

It is the second major game in the Dragon Age series and the successor to Dragon Age: Origins (2009). Set in the world of Thedas, players assume the role of Hawke, a human mage, rogue, or warrior who arrives in the city of Kirkwall as a lowly refugee, and becomes its legendary champion over a turbulent decade of political and social conflict. In the game, players explore and engage in combat from a third-person perspective. Players encounter various companions, who play major roles in the game&#39;s plot and gameplay. Depending on players&#39; decisions and dialogue, a companion will either recognize Hawke as a friend or a rival.</p>\n<p>BioWare began the game&#39;s development during the production of Origins&#39;s expansion pack Awakening. EA gave them only 14 to 16 months to finish the game&#39;s development, thus forcing the team to crunch for an extended period and reuse assets. BioWare looked at players&#39; feedback and reviews of Origins, and decided to improve its gameplay, making it more action-oriented. They improved the Eclipse Engine, renaming it Lycium, to enhance the game&#39;s visuals and lighting, and accommodate a new art style inspired by movies like Yojimbo and Conan. Mike Laidlaw, David Gaider and Inon Zur returned to their roles as lead designer, writer and composer respectively.</p>\n<p>Announced in July 2010, the game was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and OS X in March 2011. The game received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its gameplay, companions and writing; although changes to the storytelling structure and the combat system had a more mixed reception. The limited setting and reused assets were widely criticized. It received a more polarized response from players, though more than one million copies were sold in less than two weeks, a faster sales pace than its predecessor. Upon launch, BioWare supported the game with several downloadable content packs. A sequel, Dragon Age: Inquisition was released in November 2014.</p>\n	f8ddaefa-de8c-4d20-9ec9-3671b010e77a	fc670432-5567-47b6-93ec-5d414a1c560d	2011-03-08 12:00:00	{"action rpg",fantasy,"3rd person"}	{}	/images/image38.jpg	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jlACgYHtWCI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry. Active Microsoft Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT; these may encompass subfamilies, (e.g. Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact) (Windows CE). Defunct Microsoft Windows families include Windows 9x, Windows Mobile and Windows Phone.</p>\n<p>Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20, 1985, as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces (GUIs).[7] Microsoft Windows came to dominate the world&#39;s personal computer (PC) market with over 90% market share, overtaking Mac OS, which had been introduced in 1984.</p>\n<p>Apple came to see Windows as an unfair encroachment on their innovation in GUI development as implemented on products such as the Lisa and Macintosh (eventually settled in court in Microsoft&#39;s favor in 1993). On PCs, Windows is still the most popular operating system in all countries.However, in 2014, Microsoft admitted losing the majority of the overall operating system market to Android, because of the massive growth in sales of Android smartphones. In 2014, the number of Windows devices sold was less than 25% that of Android devices sold. This comparison, however, may not be fully relevant, as the two operating systems traditionally target different platforms. Still, numbers for server use of Windows (that are comparable to competitors) show one third market share, similar to that for end user use.</p>\n<p>As of October 2021, the most recent version of Windows for PCs and tablets is Windows 11, version 21H2. The most recent version for embedded devices is Windows 11, version 21H2.The most recent version for server computers is Windows Server 2022, version 21H2. A specialized version of Windows also runs on the Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S video game consoles.</p>\n	1985-11-20 00:00:00
d6899453-8c78-4e9d-bd32-1947ac852b6e	PlayStation 4	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/PlayStation_4_logo_and_wordmark.svg	<p>The PlayStation 4 (PS4) is a home video game console developed by Sony Computer Entertainment. Announced as the successor to the PlayStation 3 in February 2013, it was launched on November 15, 2013, in North America, November 29, 2013 in Europe, South America and Australia, and on February 22, 2014 in Japan. A console of the eighth generation, it competes with Microsoft&#39;s Xbox One and Nintendo&#39;s Wii U and Switch.</p>\n<p>Moving away from the more complex Cell microarchitecture of its predecessor, the console features an AMD Accelerated Processing Unit (APU) built upon the x86-64 architecture, which can theoretically peak at 1.84 teraflops; AMD stated that it was the &quot;most powerful&quot; APU it had developed to date. The PlayStation 4 places an increased emphasis on social interaction and integration with other devices and services, including the ability to play games off-console on PlayStation Vita and other supported devices (&quot;Remote Play&quot;), the ability to stream gameplay online or to friends, with them controlling gameplay remotely (&quot;Share Play&quot;). The console&#39;s controller was also redesigned and improved over the PlayStation 3, with improved buttons and analog sticks, and an integrated touchpad among other changes. The console also supports HDR10 High-dynamic-range video and playback of 4K resolution multimedia.</p>\n<p>The PlayStation 4 was released to critical acclaim, with critics praising Sony for acknowledging its consumers&#39; needs, embracing independent game development, and for not imposing the restrictive digital rights management schemes like those originally announced by Microsoft for the Xbox One. Critics and third-party studios, before its launch, also praised the capabilities of the PlayStation 4 in comparison to its competitors; developers described the performance difference between the console and Xbox One as &quot;significant&quot; and &quot;obvious&quot;. Heightened demand also helped Sony top global console sales. By October 2019, PS4 became the second-best-selling home game console of all time, behind the PlayStation 2.</p>\n<p>On September 7, 2016, Sony unveiled the PlayStation 4 Slim, a smaller version of the console; and a high-end version called the PlayStation 4 Pro, which features an upgraded GPU and a higher CPU clock rate to support enhanced performance and 4K resolution in supported games.</p>\n<p>Its successor, the PlayStation 5, was released in November 2020, with Sony discontinuing in Japan all PlayStation 4 models except the Slim version in January 2021, with it still being produced in Western markets following their statement of 3-year support of PS4.</p>\n	2013-11-15 00:00:00

Announced in May 2013, it is the successor to Xbox 360 and the third base console in the Xbox series of video game consoles. It was first released in North America, parts of Europe, Australia, and South America in November 2013 and in Japan, China, and other European countries in September 2014. It is the first Xbox game console to be released in China, specifically in the Shanghai Free-Trade Zone. Microsoft marketed the device as an &quot;all-in-one entertainment system&quot;, hence the name &quot;Xbox One&quot;. An eighth-generation console, it mainly competed against Sony&#39;s PlayStation 4 and Nintendo&#39;s Wii U and later the Switch.</p>\n<p>Moving away from its predecessor&#39;s PowerPC-based architecture, the Xbox One marks a shift back to the x86 architecture used in the original Xbox; it features an AMD Accelerated Processing Unit (APU) built around the x86-64 instruction set. Xbox One&#39;s controller was redesigned over the Xbox 360&#39;s, with a redesigned body, D-pad, and triggers capable of delivering directional haptic feedback. The console places an increased emphasis on cloud computing, as well as social networking features and the ability to record and share video clips or screenshots from gameplay or livestream directly to streaming services such as Mixer and Twitch. Games can also be played off-console via a local area network on supported Windows 10 devices. The console can play Blu-ray Disc, and overlay live television programming from an existing set-top box or a digital tuner for digital terrestrial television with an enhanced program guide. The console optionally included a redesigned Kinect sensor, marketed as the &quot;Kinect 2.0&quot;, providing improved motion tracking and voice recognition.</p>\n<p>The Xbox One received positive reviews for its refined controller design, multimedia features, and voice navigation. Its quieter and cooler design was praised for making the console more reliable than its predecessor at launch, but the console was generally criticized for running games at a technically lower graphical level than the PlayStation 4. Its original user interface was panned for being nonintuitive, although changes made to it and other aspects of the console&#39;s software post-launch received a positive reception. Its Kinect received praise for its improved motion-tracking accuracy, its face recognition logins, and its voice commands.</p>\n<p>The original Xbox One model was succeeded by the Xbox One S in 2016, which has a smaller form factor and support for HDR10 high-dynamic-range video, as well as support for 4K video playback and upscaling of games from 1080p to 4K. It was praised for its smaller size, its on-screen visual improvements, and its lack of an external power supply, but its regressions such as the lack of a native Kinect port were noted. A high-end model, named Xbox One X, was unveiled in June 2017 and released in November; it features upgraded hardware specifications and support for rendering games at 4K resolution. The system was succeeded by the Xbox Series X and Series S consoles, which launched on November 10, 2020. Production of all Xbox One consoles ceased at the end of 2020.</p>\n	2013-11-22 00:00:00

The successor to the PlayStation 2, it is part of the PlayStation brand of consoles. It was first released on November 11, 2006, in Japan, November 17, 2006, in North America, and March 23, 2007, in Europe and Australia. The PlayStation 3 competed primarily against Microsoft&#39;s Xbox 360 and Nintendo&#39;s Wii as part of the seventh generation of video game consoles.</p>\n<p>The console was first officially announced at E3 2005, and was released at the end of 2006. It was the first console to use Blu-ray Disk technology as its primary storage medium. The console was the first PlayStation to integrate social gaming services, including the PlayStation Network, as well as the first to be controllable from a handheld console, through its remote connectivity with PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita. In September 2009, the Slim model of the PlayStation 3 was released. It no longer provided the hardware ability to run PS2 games. It was lighter and thinner than the original version, and featured a redesigned logo and marketing design, as well as a minor start-up change in software. A Super Slim variation was then released in late 2012, further refining and redesigning the console.</p>\n<p>During its early years, the system received a mixed reception, due to its high price ($599 for a 60-gigabyte model, $499 for a 20 GB model), a complex processor architecture, and lack of quality games but was praised for its Blu-ray capabilities and &quot;untapped potential&quot;. The reception would get more positive over time. The system had a slow start in the market but managed to recover, particularly after the introduction of the Slim model. Its successor, the PlayStation 4, was released later in November 2013. On September 29, 2015, Sony confirmed that sales of the PlayStation 3 were to be discontinued in New Zealand, but the system remained in production in other markets. Shipments of new units to Europe and Australia ended in March 2016, followed by North America which ended in October 2016. Heading into 2017, Japan was the last territory where new units were still being produced until May 29, 2017, when Sony confirmed the PlayStation 3 was discontinued in Japan.</p>\n	2006-11-11 00:00:00

As the successor to the original Xbox, it is the second console in the Xbox series. It competed with Sony&#39;s PlayStation 3 and Nintendo&#39;s Wii as part of the seventh generation of video game consoles. It was officially unveiled on MTV on May 12, 2005, with detailed launch and game information announced later that month at the 2005 Electronic Entertainment Expo.</p>\n<p>The Xbox 360 features an online service, Xbox Live, which was expanded from its previous iteration on the original Xbox and received regular updates during the console&#39;s lifetime. Available in free and subscription-based varieties, Xbox Live allows users to: play games online; download games (through Xbox Live Arcade) and game demos; purchase and stream music, television programs, and films through the Xbox Music and Xbox Video portals; and access third-party content services through media streaming applications. In addition to online multimedia features, it allows users to stream media from local PCs. Several peripherals have been released, including wireless controllers, expanded hard drive storage, and the Kinect motion sensing camera. The release of these additional services and peripherals helped the Xbox brand grow from gaming-only to encompassing all multimedia, turning it into a hub for living-room computing entertainment.</p>\n<p>Launched worldwide across 2005–2006, the Xbox 360 was initially in short supply in many regions, including North America and Europe. The earliest versions of the console suffered from a high failure rate, indicated by the so-called &quot;Red Ring of Death&quot;, necessitating an extension of the device&#39;s warranty period. Microsoft released two redesigned models of the console: the Xbox 360 S in 2010,[27] and the Xbox 360 E in 2013. Xbox 360 is the sixth-highest-selling home video game console in history, and the highest-selling console made by an American company. Although not the best-selling console of its generation, the Xbox 360 was deemed by TechRadar to be the most influential through its emphasis on digital media distribution and multiplayer gaming on Xbox Live.</p>\n<p>The Xbox 360&#39;s successor, the Xbox One, was released on November 22, 2013. On April 20, 2016, Microsoft announced that it would end the production of new Xbox 360 hardware, although the company will continue to support the platform.</p>\n	2005-11-22 00:00:00

Announced in 2019 as the successor to the PlayStation 4, the PS5 was released on November 12, 2020, in Australia, Japan, New Zealand, North America, and South Korea, with worldwide release following a week later. The PS5 is part of the ninth generation of video game consoles, along with Microsoft&#39;s Xbox Series X and Series S consoles, which were released in the same month.</p>\n<p>The base model includes an optical disc drive compatible with Ultra HD Blu-ray discs. The Digital Edition lacks this drive, allowing it to serve as a lower-cost model for those who prefer to buy games through digital download. The two variants were launched simultaneously.</p>\n<p>The PlayStation 5&#39;s main hardware features include a solid-state drive customized for high-speed data streaming to enable significant improvements in storage performance, an AMD GPU capable of 4K resolution display at up to 120 frames per second, hardware-accelerated ray tracing for realistic lighting and reflections, and the Tempest Engine allowing for hardware-accelerated 3D audio effects. Other features include the DualSense controller with haptic feedback and backward compatibility with the majority of PlayStation 4 and PlayStation VR games.</p>\n	2020-11-12 00:00:00

They were both released on November 10, 2020, as the fourth generation of the Xbox console family, succeeding the Xbox One. Along with Sony&#39;s PlayStation 5, also released in November 2020, the Xbox Series X and Series S are part of the ninth generation of video game consoles.[3]</p>\n<p>Rumors regarding the consoles first emerged in early 2019, with the line as a whole codenamed &quot;Scarlett&quot; and consisting of high-end and lower-end models codenamed &quot;Anaconda&quot; as well as &quot;Lockhart&quot; respectively. Internally, Microsoft had been satisfied with the two-console approach for the Xbox One and planned a similar approach for the fourth generation Xbox, with the target for the high-end model to at least double the performance of the Xbox One X. The high-end model was first teased during E3 2019 under the title &quot;Project Scarlett&quot;, while its name and design as Xbox Series X was unveiled during The Game Awards later in December. In September 2020, Microsoft unveiled the lower-end model, the Xbox Series S.</p>\n<p>The Xbox Series X has higher-end hardware and supports higher display resolutions (up to 8K resolution), along with higher frame rates and real-time ray tracing; it also has a high-speed solid-state drive (SSD) to reduce loading times. The less expensive Xbox Series S uses the same CPU, but has a less powerful GPU, has less memory and internal storage, and lacks an optical drive. Both consoles are designed to support nearly all Xbox One games, controllers and accessories, including those games from older Xbox consoles supported by Xbox One&#39;s backwards compatibility. At launch, Microsoft positioned their first-party games and several third-party games to be available for both Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One to help transition between generations, providing the &quot;Smart Delivery&quot; distribution framework to freely provide further optimizations of an Xbox One game for either the Xbox Series X or Series S. The consoles are also compatible with the gaming subscription service Xbox Game Pass, as well as the cloud game-streaming platform Xbox Cloud Gaming.</p>\n	2020-11-10 00:00:00

The system&#39;s primary controller is the Wii U GamePad, which features an embedded touchscreen, directional buttons, analog sticks, and action buttons. The screen can be used either as a supplement to the main display or in supported games to play the game directly on the GamePad. The Wii U Pro Controller can be used in its place as a more traditional alternative. The Wii U is backward compatible with all Wii software and accessories. Games can support any combination of the GamePad, Wii Remote, Nunchuk, Balance Board, or Nintendo&#39;s Classic Controller or Wii U Pro Controller. Online functionality centers around the Nintendo Network platform and Miiverse, an integrated social networking service which allowed users to share content in game-specific communities.</p>\n<p>Response to the Wii U was mixed. It was praised for its innovative GamePad controller, improvements to online functionality over the Wii, backwards compatibility with Wii software and peripherals, and price; however, it was criticized for its user interface and functionality, and the GamePad&#39;s short battery life. It had low sales, primarily credited to a weak lineup of launch games,[13] limited third-party support,[14] and poor marketing including the lack of distinguishing the unique functionality of the GamePad from just being a tablet device for the Wii. Wii U production ended in January 2017. On March 3, 2017, Nintendo released its successor, the Nintendo Switch, which retained and refined concepts introduced with the Wii U.</p>\n	2012-11-18 00:00:00

It is the primary operating system for Apple&#39;s Mac computers. Within the market of desktop and laptop computers it is the second most widely used desktop OS, after Microsoft Windows and ahead of Chrome OS.</p>\n<p>macOS succeeded the classic Mac OS, a Macintosh operating system with nine releases from 1984 to 1999. During this time, Apple cofounder Steve Jobs had left Apple and started another company, NeXT, developing the NeXTSTEP platform that would later be acquired by Apple to form the basis of macOS.</p>\n<p>The first desktop version, Mac OS X 10.0, was released in March 2001, with its first update, 10.1, arriving later that year. All releases from Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard and after are UNIX 03 certified, with an exception for OS X 10.7 Lion. Apple&#39;s mobile operating system, iOS, has been considered a variant of macOS.</p>\n<p>A prominent part of macOS&#39;s original brand identity was the use of Roman numeral X, pronounced &quot;ten&quot; as in Mac OS X and also the iPhone X, as well as code naming each release after species of big cats, or places within California. Apple shortened the name to &quot;OS X&quot; in 2012 and then changed it to &quot;macOS&quot; in 2016 to align with the branding of Apple&#39;s other operating systems, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS. After sixteen distinct versions of macOS 10, macOS Big Sur was presented as version 11 in 2020, and macOS Monterey was presented as version 12 in 2021.</p>\n<p>macOS has supported three major processor architectures, beginning with PowerPC-based Macs in 1999. In 2006, Apple transitioned to the Intel architecture with a line of Macs using Intel Core processors. In 2020, Apple began the Apple silicon transition, using self-designed, 64-bit ARM-based Apple M1 processors on the latest Macintosh computers.</p>\n	2001-03-24 00:00:00

The console itself is a tablet that can either be docked for use as a home console or used as a portable device, making it a hybrid console. Its wireless Joy-Con controllers, with standard buttons and directional analog sticks for user input, motion sensing, and tactile feedback, can attach to both sides of the console to support handheld-style play. They can also connect to a grip accessory to provide a traditional home console gamepad form, or be used individually in the hand like the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, supporting local multiplayer modes. The Nintendo Switch&#39;s software supports online gaming through Internet connectivity, as well as local wireless ad hoc connectivity with other consoles. Nintendo Switch games and software are available on both physical flash-based ROM cartridges and digital distribution via Nintendo eShop; the system has no region lockout. A handheld-focused revision of the system, called the Nintendo Switch Lite, was released on September 20, 2019. A revised higher-end version of the original system, featuring an OLED screen, was released on October 8, 2021.</p>\n<p>The Nintendo Switch was unveiled on October 20, 2016. Known in development by its codename NX, the concept of the Switch came about as Nintendo&#39;s reaction to several quarters of financial losses into 2014, attributed to poor sales of its previous console, the Wii U, and market competition from mobile games. Nintendo&#39;s then-president Satoru Iwata pushed the company towards mobile gaming and novel hardware. The Nintendo Switch&#39;s design is aimed at a wide demographic of video game players through multiple modes of use. Nintendo opted to use more standard electronic components, such as a chipset based on Nvidia&#39;s Tegra line, to make development for the console easier for programmers and more compatible with existing game engines. As the Wii U had struggled to gain external support, leaving it with a weak software library, Nintendo preemptively sought the support of many third-party developers and publishers to help build out the Switch&#39;s game library alongside Nintendo&#39;s first-party titles, including many independent video game studios. While Nintendo initially anticipated around 100 titles for its first year, over 320 titles from first-party, third-party, and independent developers were released by the end of 2017.</p>\n<p>As an eighth-generation console, the Nintendo Switch competes with Microsoft&#39;s Xbox One and Sony&#39;s PlayStation 4. Nearly three million console units were shipped in its first month, exceeding Nintendo&#39;s initial projection of two million and within a year of release achieved over 14 million units sold worldwide, outselling total lifetime sales of the Wii U. By the start of 2018, the Switch became the fastest-selling home or hybrid console in both Japan and the United States. As of March 2022, all Nintendo Switch models have sold nearly 108 million units worldwide, making it Nintendo&#39;s best-selling home console and the fifth-bestselling game console of all time. Sales of the Switch have been strongly tied to sales of Nintendo&#39;s first-party titles, with six games—The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Super Mario Odyssey, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Pokémon Sword and Shield, and Animal Crossing: New Horizons—having sold over twenty million units each.</p>\n	2017-03-03 00:00:00

It serves as the publishing business for its parent company, Activision Blizzard, and consists of several subsidiary studios. Activision is one of the largest third-party video game publishers in the world and was the top United States publisher in 2016.</p>\n<p>The company was founded as Activision, Inc. on October 1, 1979 in Sunnyvale, California, by former Atari game developers upset at their treatment by Atari in order to develop their own games for the popular Atari 2600 home video game console. Activision was the first independent, third-party, console video game developer. The 1983 video game crash, in part created by too many new companies trying to follow in Activision&#39;s footsteps without the expertise of Activision&#39;s founders, hurt Activision&#39;s position in console games and forced the company to diversify into games for home computers, including the acquisition of Infocom. After a management shift, with CEO Jim Levy replaced by Bruce Davis, the company renamed itself to Mediagenic and branched out into business software applications. Mediagenic quickly fell into debt, and the company was bought for around US$500,000 by Bobby Kotick and a small group of investors around 1991.</p>\n<p>Kotick drastically revamped and restructured the company to get it out of debt: dismissing most of its staff, moving the company to Los Angeles, and reverting to the Activision name. Building on existing assets, the Kotick-led Activision pursued more publishing opportunities and, after recovering from its former financial troubles, started acquiring numerous studios and various types of intellectual property over the 1990s and 2000s, among these being the Call of Duty and Guitar Hero series. A holding company was formed as Activision&#39;s parent company to manage both its internal and acquired studios. In 2008, this holding company merged with Vivendi Games (the parent company of Blizzard Entertainment) and formed Activision Blizzard, with Kotick as its CEO. Within this structure, Activision manages numerous third-party studios and publishes all games besides those created by Blizzard.</p>\n	United States

(Polish: [ˌt͡sɛˈdɛ ˈprɔjɛkt]) is a Polish video game developer, publisher and distributor based in Warsaw, founded in May 1994 by Marcin Iwiński and Michał Kiciński. Iwiński and Kiciński were video game retailers before they founded the company, which initially acted as a distributor of foreign video games for the domestic market. The department responsible for developing original games, CD Projekt Red (stylised as CD PROJEKT RED), best known for The Witcher series, was formed in 2002. In 2008, CD Projekt launched the digital distribution service Good Old Games, now known as GOG.com.</p>\n<p>The company began by translating major video-game releases into Polish, collaborating with Interplay Entertainment for two Baldur&#39;s Gate games. CD Projekt was working on the PC version of Baldur&#39;s Gate: Dark Alliance when Interplay experienced financial difficulties. The game was cancelled and the company decided to reuse the code for their own video game. It became The Witcher, a video game based on the works of novelist Andrzej Sapkowski.</p>\n<p>After the release of The Witcher, CD Projekt worked on a console port called The Witcher: White Wolf; but development issues and increasing costs almost led the company to the brink of bankruptcy. CD Projekt later released The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings in 2011 and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt in 2015, with the latter winning various Game of the Year awards. In 2020, the company released Cyberpunk 2077, a role-playing game based on the Cyberpunk 2020 tabletop game system for which it opened a new division in Wrocław.</p>\n<p>A video game distribution service, GOG.com, was established by CD Projekt to help players find old games. Its mission is to offer games free of digital rights management (DRM) to players and its service was expanded to cover new AAA and independent games.</p>\n<p>In 2009, CD Projekt&#39;s then-parent company, CDP Investment, announced its plans to merge with Optimus S.A. in a deal intended to reorganise CD Projekt as a publicly traded company. The merger was closed in December 2010 with Optimus as the legal surviving entity; Optimus became the current incarnation of CD Projekt S.A. in July 2011. By September 2017, it was the largest publicly traded video game company in Poland, worth about US$2.3 billion, and by May 2020, had reached a valuation of US$8.1 billion, making it the largest video game company in Europe. In March 2018, the company joined WIG20, an index of the 20 largest companies on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.</p>\n	Poland
